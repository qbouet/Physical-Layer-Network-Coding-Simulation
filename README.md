# Physical Layer Network Coding Simulation

Physical Network Coding (PNC) makes use of the additive nature of simultaneously arriving electromagnetic (EM)
waves for equivalent coding operation. The goal was to analyze the error rate performance when directly decoding the
superimposed signal to the network-coded signal.
